# Mustache

Inspired by [ctemplate][1] and [et][2], Mustache is a
framework-agnostic way to render logic-free views.

As ctemplates says, "It emphasizes separating logic from presentation:
it is impossible to embed application logic in this template language."

For a list of implementations (other than Ruby) and tips, see
<http://mustache.github.com/>.

For a language-agnostic overview of Mustacheâ€™s template syntax, see the
`mustache(5)` manpage or <http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html>.

## Why?

Mustache.xq is designed to help you when:
1 You want to avoid fn:concat to generate strings to keep your code more readible
2. Want to render json as a string

Mustache.xq was designed using MarkLogic Server <http://marklogic.com/> but can be used in any XQuery processor

## Contribute

Everyone is welcome to contribute. 
To do so simply fork the project in github, do your changes, test your changes and make a pull request.

The documentation is severely lacking. Feel free to contribute to the wiki if you think something could be improved.

### Running the tests

To run the tests simply point an MarkLogic HTTP AppServer to the root of mustache.xqy

You can run the tests by accessing:
(assuming 127.0.0.1 is the host and 8090 is the port)

    http://127.0.0.1:8090/tests

Make sure all the tests pass before sending in your pull request!

### Tests

If you want to contribute with a test case please file a [issue][2] and attach the following information:

* Name
* Template
* Hash
* Output

This will help us be faster fixing the problem.

An example for a Hello World test would be:

    <test name="Simple Mustache">
       <template>{'Hello {{word}}'}</template>
       <hash>{'{"word": "world"}'}</hash>
       <output>{'Hello world'}</output>
       <parseTree>
         <multi/>
       </parseTree>
     </test>

## Usage

A quick example how to use mustache.xq:

    import module namespace mustache = "mustache.xq"
     at "mustache.xqy";
    mustache:render( 'Hello {{text}}!', '{ "text": "world"}' )

Returns

    Hello world!
